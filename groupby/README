Please read this file by running the program. This file
is organized in three parts:

a) Input assumptions
-> An input data file must follow the below format
aaaaaa bbbbbb
cccccc dddddd
......
The first element of every row is the key for that row, while
the second element is the value of that row.
All keys share the same length, and all values share
the same length as well.

-> Every key or value only contains lowercase ASCII characters.

-> Although the data can be larger than the memory size, we assume
that the size of all keys is smaller than the memory size. Thus,
we can cache all keys in the memory.

b) Output assumption:
In the output, we allow duplicated values for a key, and we will
not sort value strings.

c) Compile

d) Run with parameters
